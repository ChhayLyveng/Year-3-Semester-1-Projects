## Key Learning Objectives
* **Data Acquisition & Engineering:** Mastered diverse data collection methods, including Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup/Requests) for unstructured data and conducting Primary Research through student surveys.
* **Mathematical Optimization:** Developed a deep conceptual and practical understanding of Stochastic Linear Programming, including solving complex problems via the L-Shape Decomposition and manual Simplex methods.
* **Statistical Mastery:** Applied rigorous statistical frameworks, from Point Estimation and Confidence Intervals to Hypothesis Testing, ensuring data-driven conclusions are mathematically sound.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed comprehensive analysis on large-scale datasets (e.g., Zomato Kaggle dataset) using the Python data stack to uncover trends and patterns.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Implemented and evaluated Linear Regression models to move beyond description into data-driven forecasting.
* **Data Visualization:** Created impactful visual narratives using Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate findings from both secondary and primary data sources.
