# Introduction to Data Science 📊

## Project Scope
This project covers the fundamental lifecycle of a Data Science project, focusing on transforming raw data into actionable insights through rigorous preprocessing and modeling.

## Key Features
* **Data Description & Cleaning:** Handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.
* **Applied Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing data distribution and central tendencies.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns and correlations.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating intuitive charts to represent complex relationships.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Implementing **Linear Regression** to forecast outcomes.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Data
* **Students** can pick any topic and data they want, my team project choose to anlysis Netflex TVShows and Movies Data 2023 from kaggle to analysis
* We apply linear regression by calling it from library scikit-learn to use and we wanr predict target variable (duration of movies) based on selected variable such as year_realease, coutry code, some engineering features, etc
