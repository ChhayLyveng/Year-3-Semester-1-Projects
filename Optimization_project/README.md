# Stochastic Linear Programming Project 

## Overview
A deep dive into mathematical optimization under uncertainty parameter which is random varible. This project moves beyond deterministic models to explore problems where parameters are probabilistic.

## Core Content
* **Conceptual Understanding:** Modeling "Here-and-Now" vs. "Wait-and-See" decisions.
* **Algebraic Method:** Formulating the Extensive Form of stochastic problems.
* **Simplex Method:** Solving optimization problems manually to understand algorithmic flow.
* **L-Shape Decomposition:** Implementing the Van Slyke and Wets algorithm to handle large-scale recourse problems.

## Lessons Learned
* How to manage computational complexity in multi-stage problems.
* Transitioning theoretical algebraic formulations into solvable linear programs.
